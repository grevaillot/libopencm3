Devices can have up to three SPI peripherals. The common 4-wire full-duplex
mode of operation is supported, along with 3-wire variants using unidirectional
communication modes or half-duplex bidirectional communication. A variety of
options allows many of the SPI variants to be supported. Multimaster operation
is also supported. A CRC can be generated and checked in hardware.

@note Some JTAG pins need to be remapped if SPI is to be used.

@note The I2S protocol shares the SPI hardware so the two protocols cannot be
used at the same time on the same peripheral.

Example: Clk/4, positive clock polarity, leading edge trigger, 8-bit words,
LSB first.
@code
	spi_init_master(SPI1, SPI_CR1_BAUDRATE_FPCLK_DIV_4, SPI_CR1_CPOL_CLK_TO_0_WHEN_IDLE,
			SPI_CR1_CPHA_CLK_TRANSITION_1, SPI_CR1_LSBFIRST);
	spi_write(SPI1, 0x55);		// 8-bit write
	spi_write(SPI1, 0xaa88);	// 16-bit write
	reg8 = spi_read(SPI1);		// 8-bit read
	reg16 = spi_read(SPI1);		// 16-bit read
@endcode

@todo need additional functions to aid ISRs in retrieving status
